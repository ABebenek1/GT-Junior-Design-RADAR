# GT-Junior-Design-RADAR
This is the GitHub repository for Georgia Tech Spring 2023 junior design team 2313, working on the RADAR project with Emory University Radiology Residency program. The vision and goal of this project is to help the resident users keep track of their historical and current performance in the residency program, and to help the administrators and advisors gain a holistic view of the performance of the residency cohort.

# Release Notes

Welcome to version 1.0 of the Radiology Analytical DAshboard for Residents (RADAR)! In our first release of the webpage, we have created a dashboard for you, the residents of Emory Hospitalâ€™s radiology department, to help you track your performance in the radiology residency. 

### Features

    * By clicking view next to a resident's name, administrators can view that resident's statistics

  * Delete resident
    * An administrator can delete a resident by selecting the delete button

### Bug Fixes

### Bugs
* Date range selection is not implemented in the backend
* Signing up as a new user doesn't guarantee the users information will be stored in the database
* View/Comment/Delete functions on admin dashboard are not linked to resident dashboard and will not show up on the resident dashboard
